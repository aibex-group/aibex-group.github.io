 abstract = {Graphs are an intuitive and natural way of representing  handwriting. Due to their high representational power, they  have shown high performances in different learning-free  document analysis tasks. While machine learning is rather  unexplored for graph representations, geometric deep  learning offers a novel framework that allows for  convolutional neural networks similar to the image domain.  In this work, we show that the concept of attribute  prediction can be adapted to the graph domain. We propose a  graph neural network to map handwritten word graphs to a  symbolic attribute space. This mapping allows to perform  query-by-example word spotting as it was also tackled by  other learning-free approaches in the graph domain.  Furthermore, our model is capable of query-by-string, which  is out of scope for other graph-based methods in the  literature. We investigate two variants of graph  convolutional layers and show that learning improves  performances considerably on two popular graph-based word  spotting benchmarks.},
