 abstract = {The basic idea of a recent graph matching framework is to  reduce the problem of graph edit distance (GED) to an  instance of a linear sum assignment problem (LSAP). The  optimal solution for this simplified GED problem can be  computed in cubic time and is eventually used to derive a  suboptimal solution for the original GED problem. Yet, for  large scale graphs and/or large scale graph sets the cubic  time complexity remains a severe handicap of this  procedure. Therefore, we propose to use suboptimal  algorithms – with quadratic rather than cubic time  complexity – for solving the underlying LSAP. In  particular, we introduce several greedy assignment  algorithms for approximating GED. In an experimental  evaluation we show that there is great potential for  further speeding up the GED computation. Moreover, we  empirically confirm that the distances obtained by this  procedure remain sufficiently accurate for graph based  pattern classification.},
