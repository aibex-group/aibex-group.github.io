 abstract = {Büchi Automata on infinite words present many interesting  problems and are used frequently in program verification  and model checking. A lot of these problems on Büchi  automata are computationally hard, raising the question if  a learning-based data-driven analysis might be more  efficient than using traditional algorithms. Since Büchi  automata can be represented by graphs, graph neural  networks are a natural choice for such a learning-based  analysis. In this paper, we demonstrate how graph neural  networks can be used to reliably predict basic properties  of Büchi automata when trained on automatically generated  random automata datasets.},
