 abstract = {The development of predictive tools has been commonly  utilized as the most effective manner to prevent illnesses  that strike suddenly. Within this context, investigations  linking fine human motor control with brain stroke risk  factors are considered to have a high potential but they  are still in an early stage of research. The present paper  analyses neuromuscular features of oscillatory movements  based on the Omega-Lognormal model of the Kinematic Theory.  On a database of oscillatory movements from 120 subjects,  we demonstrate that the proposed features differ  significantly between subjects with and without brain  stroke risk factors. This promising result motivates the  development of predictive tools based on the  Omega-Lognormal model.},
