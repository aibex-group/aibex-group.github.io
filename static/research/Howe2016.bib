 abstract = {Inkball models provide a tool for matching and comparison  of spatially structured markings such as handwritten  characters and words. Hidden Markov models offer a  framework for decoding a stream of text in terms of the  most likely sequence of causal states. Prior work with HMM  has relied on observation of features that are correlated  with underlying characters, without modeling them directly.  This paper proposes to use the results of inkball-based  character matching as a feature set input directly to the  HMM. Experiments indicate that this technique outperforms  other tested methods at handwritten word recognition on a  common benchmark when applied without normalization or text  deslanting.},
