 abstract = {What can be done with only one enrolled real hand-written  signature in Automatic Signature Verification (ASV)? Using  5 or 10 signatures for training is the most common case to  evaluate ASV. In the scarcely addressed case of only one  available signature for training, we propose to use  modified duplicates. Our novel technique relies on a fully  neuromuscular representation of the signatures based on the  Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements and its  Sigma-Lognormal model. This way, a real on-line signature  is converted into the Sigma-Lognormal model domain. The  model parameters are then varied to generate new duplicated  signatures.},
