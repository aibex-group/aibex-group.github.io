 abstract = {In this work, we present a framework supported by mobile  and web apps and able to propose personalized pedestrian  routes that match user mobility profile considering  mobility impediments factors. We explain how these later  have been defined using a pedestrian-centric approach based  on travel experiences as perceived in the field by senior  citizens. Through workshops, six main factors that may  influence pedestrian route choices were revealed:  passability, obstacle in path, surface problem, security,  sidewalk width, slope. These categories were used to build  digital tools and guide a citizen participatory approach to  collect geolocated points of obstacle documented with  walkability information (picture, category, impact score,  free comment). We also involved citizens to evaluate these  information and especially senior referents for validation.  Finally we present how we connect these points of obstacle  with a pedestrian network based on OpenStreetMap to  configure a routing cost function. The framework has been  partially deployed in 2020 with limited people due to the  pandemic. Nonetheless, we share lessons learned from  interaction with citizens in the design of such a framework  whose underlying workflow is reproducible. We plan to  further assess its relevance and sustainability in the  future.},
