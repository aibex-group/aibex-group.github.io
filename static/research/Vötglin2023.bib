 abstract = {Deep learning methods have shown strong performance in  solving tasks for historical document image analysis.  However, despite current libraries and frameworks,  programming an experiment or a set of experiments and  executing them can be time-consuming. This is why we  propose an open-source deep learning framework, DIVA-DAF,  which is based on PyTorch Lightning and specifically  designed for historical document analysis. Pre-implemented  tasks such as segmentation and classification can be easily  used or customized. It is also easy to create one’s own  tasks with the benefit of powerful modules for loading  data, even large data sets, and different forms of ground  truth. The applications conducted have demonstrated time  savings for the programming of a document analysis task, as  well as for different scenarios such as pre-training or  changing the architecture. Thanks to its data module, the  framework also allows to reduce the time of model training  significantly.},
