 abstract = {Supervised learning is conditioned by the availability of  labeled data, which are especially expensive to acquire in  the field of medical image analysis. Making use of  open-source data for pre-training or using domain  adaptation can be a way to overcome this issue. However,  pre-trained networks often fail to generalize to new test  domains that are not distributed identically due to  variations in tissue stainings, types, and textures.  Additionally, current domain adaptation methods mainly rely  on fully-labeled source datasets. In this work, we propose  Self-Rule to Adapt (SRA) which takes advantage of  self-supervised learning to perform domain adaptation and  removes the burden of fully-labeled source datasets. SRA  can effectively transfer the discriminative knowledge  obtained from a few labeled source domain to a new target  domain without requiring additional tissue annotations. Our  method harnesses both domains’ structures by capturing  visual similarity with intra-domain and cross-domain  self-supervision. We show that our proposed method  outperforms baselines across diverse domain adaptation  settings and further validate our approach to our in-house  clinical cohort.},
