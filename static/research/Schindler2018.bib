 abstract = {The Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements and its  Sigma-Lognormal model enables to model human gestures, in  particular complex handwriting patterns such as words,  signatures and free gestures. This paper investigates the  extension of the theory and its Sigma-Lognormal model from  two dimensions to three, taking into account new  acquisition modalities (motion capture), multiple subjects,  and unconstrained motions. Despite the increased complexity  and the new acquisition modalities, we demonstrate that the  Sigma-Lognormal model can be successfully generalized to  describe 3D human movements. Starting from the 2D model, we  replace circular with spherical motions to derive a  representation of unconstrained human movements with a new  3D Sigma-Lognormal model. First experiments show a high  reconstruction quality with an average signal-tonoise ratio  (SNR) of 18.52 dB on the HDM05 dataset. Gesture recognition  using dynamic time warping (DTW) achieves similar  recognition accuracies when using original and  reconstructed gestures, which confirms the high quality of  the proposed model.},
