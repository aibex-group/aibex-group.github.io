 abstract = {Computer-aided diagnostics in histopathology are based on  the digitization of glass slides. However, heterogeneity  between the images generated by different slide scanners  can unfavorably affect the performance of computational  algorithms. Here, we evaluate the impact of scanner  variability on lymph node segmentation due to its clinical  importance in colorectal cancer diagnosis. 100 slides  containing 276 lymph nodes were digitized using 4 different  slide scanners, and 50 of the lymph nodes containing  metastatic cancer cells. These 400 scans were subsequently  annotated by 2 experienced pathologists to precisely label  lymph node boundary. Three different segmentation methods  were then applied and compared: Hematoxylin-channel-based  thresholding (HCT), Hematoxylin-based active contours  (HAC), and a convolution neural network (U-Net). Evaluation  of U-Net trained from both a single scanner and an ensemble  of all scanners was completed. Mosaic images based on  representative tiles from a scanner were used as a  reference image to normalize the new data from different  test scanners to evaluate the performance of a pre-trained  model. Fine-tuning was carried out by using weights of a  model trained on one scanner to initialize model weights  for other scanners. To evaluate the domain generalization,  domain adversarial learning and stain mix-up augmentation  were also implemented. Results show that fine-tuning and  domain adversarial learning decreased the impact of scanner  variability and greatly improved segmentation across  scanners. Overall, U-Net with stain mix-up (Matthews  correlation coefficient (MCC) = 0.87), domain adversarial  learning (MCC = 0.86), and HAC (MCC = 0.87) were shown to  outperform HCT (MCC = 0.81) for segmentation of lymph nodes  when compared against the ground truth. The findings of  this study should be considered for future algorithms  applied in diagnostic routines.},
