 abstract = {Colon resection is often the treatment of choice for  colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. However, especially for  minimally invasive cancer, such as pT1, simply removing the  polyps may be enough to stop cancer progression. Different  histopathological risk factors such as tumor grade and  invasion depth currently found the basis for the need for  colon resection in pT1 CRC patients. Here, we investigate  two additional risk factors, tumor budding and lymphocyte  infiltration at the invasive front, which are known to be  clinically relevant. We capture the spatial layout of tumor  buds and T-cells and use graph-based deep learning to  investigate them as potential risk predictors. Our pT1  Hotspot Tumor Budding T-cell Graph (pT1-HBTG) dataset  consists of 626 tumor budding hotspots from 575 patients.  We propose and compare three different graph structures, as  well as combinations of the node labels. The  best-performing Graph Neural Network architecture is able  to increase specificity by 20% compared to the currently  recommended risk stratification based on histopathological  risk factors, without losing any sensitivity. We believe  that using a graph-based analysis can help to assist  pathologists in making risk assessments for pT1 CRC  patients, and thus decrease the number of patients  undergoing potentially unnecessary surgery. Both the code  and dataset are made publicly available.},
