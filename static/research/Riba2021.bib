 abstract = {The emergence of geometric deep learning as a novel  framework to deal with graph-based representations has  faded away traditional approaches in favor of completely  new methodologies. In this paper, we propose a new  framework able to combine the advances on deep metric  learning with traditional approximations of the graph edit  distance. Hence, we propose an efficient graph distance  based on the novel field of geometric deep learning. Our  method employs a message passing neural network to capture  the graph structure, and thus, leveraging this information  for its use on a distance computation. The performance of  the proposed graph distance is validated on two different  scenarios. On the one hand, in a graph retrieval of  handwritten words i.e. keyword spotting, showing its  superior performance when compared with (approximate) graph  edit distance benchmarks. On the other hand, demonstrating  competitive results for graph similarity learning when  compared with the current state-of-the-art on a recent  benchmark dataset.},
