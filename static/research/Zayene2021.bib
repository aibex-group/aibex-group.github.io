 abstract = {After the success of the two first editions of the “Arabic  Text in Videos Competition—AcTiVComp”, we are proposing to  organize a new edition in conjunction with the 25th  International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR’20).  The main objective is to contribute in the research field  of text detection and recognition in multimedia documents,  with a focus on Arabic text in video frames. The former  editions were held in the framework of ICPR’16 and ICDAR’17  conferences. The obtained results on the AcTiV dataset have  shown that there is still room for improvement in both text  detection and recognition tasks. Four groups with five  systems are participating to this edition of AcTiVComp  (three for the detection task and two for the recognition  task). All the submitted systems have followed a CRNN-based  architecture, which is now the de facto choice for text  detection and OCR problems. The achieved results are very  interesting, showing a significant improvement from the  state-of-the-art performances on this field of research.},
