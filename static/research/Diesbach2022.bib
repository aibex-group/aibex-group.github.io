 abstract = {Images of historical Vietnamese steles allow historians to  discover invaluable information regarding the past of the  country, especially about the life of people in rural  villages. Due to the sheer amount of available stone  engravings and their diverseness, manual examination is  difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, automatic document  analysis methods based on machine learning could immensely  facilitate this laborious work. However, creating ground  truth for machine learning is also complex and  time-consuming for human experts, which is why synthetic  training samples greatly support learning while reducing  human effort. In particular, they can be used to train deep  neural networks for character detection and recognition. In  this paper, we present a method for creating synthetic  engravings and use it to create a new database composed of  26,901 synthetic Chu Nom characters in 21 different styles.  Using a machine learning model for unpaired image-to-image  translation, our approach is annotation-free, i.e. there is  no need for human experts to label character images. A user  study demonstrates that the synthetic engravings look  realistic to the human eye.},
