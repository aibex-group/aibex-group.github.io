 abstract = {We propose to classify intestinal glands as normal or  dysplastic using cell-graphs and graph-based deep learning  methods. Dysplastic intestinal glands can lead to  colorectal cancer, which is one of the three most common  cancer types in the world. In order to assess the cancer  stage and thus the treatment of a patient, pathologists  analyse tissue samples of affected patients. Among other  factors, they look at the changes in morphology of  different tissues, such as the intestinal glands.  Cell-graphs have a high representational power and can  describe topological and geometrical properties of  intestinal glands. However, classical graph-based methods  have a high computational complexity and there is only a  limited range of machine learning methods available. In  this paper, we propose Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an  efficient learning-based approach to classify cell-graphs.  We investigate different variants of so-called Message  Passing Neural Networks and compare them with a classical  graph-based approach based on approximated Graph Edit  Distance and k-nearest neighbours classifier. A promising  classification accuracy of 94.8% is achieved by the  proposed method on the pT1 Gland Graph dataset, which is an  increase of 11.5% over the baseline result.},
