 abstract = {Stone engravings in Historical Vietnamese steles allow  historians to study the life of common people in the  villages. Only recently, a large amount of images of such  engravings have become available. For supporting the  historians, automatic document analysis systems are needed  for reading the ancient Chu NÃ´m characters that are written  in columns from top to bottom. In this paper, we study the  problem of layout analysis, which is the first step of  automatic reading. Semantic segmentation is applied at  pixel-level to find the title, main text, label, and  reference number on the page using deep convolutional  neural networks. Afterwards, seam carving is used to  segment the text columns within the main text. We present  baseline results for hundred exemplary pages, discuss error  cases, and outline lines of future research.},
