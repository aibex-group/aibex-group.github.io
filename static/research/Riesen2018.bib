 abstract = {The concept of graph edit distance constitutes one of the  most flexible graph matching paradigms available. The major  drawback of graph edit distance, viz. the exponential time  complexity, has been recently overcome by means of a  reformulation of the edit distance problem to a linear sum  assignment problem. However, the substantial speed up of  the matching is also accompanied by an approximation error  on the distances. Major contribution of this paper is the  introduction of a transformation process in order to  convert the underlying cost model into a utility model. The  benefit of this transformation is that it enables the  integration of additional information in the assignment  process. We empirically confirm the positive effects of  this transformation on five benchmark graph sets with  respect to the accuracy and run time of a distance based  classifier.},
