 abstract = {In recent years, libraries and archives all around the  world have increased their efforts to digitize historical  manuscripts. To integrate the manuscripts into digital  libraries, pattern recognition and machine learning methods  are needed to extract and index the contents of the scanned  images.

The unique compendium describes the outcome of the  HisDoc research project, a pioneering attempt to study the  whole processing chain of layout analysis, handwriting  recognition, and retrieval of historical manuscripts. This  description is complemented with an overview of other  related research projects, in order to convey the current  state of the art in the field and outline future  trends.

This must-have volume is a relevant reference work  for librarians, archivists and computer scientists.},
