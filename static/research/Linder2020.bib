 abstract = {This paper presents SwissCrawl, the largest Swiss German  text corpus to date. Composed of more than half a million  sentences, it was generated using a customized web scraping  tool that could be applied to other low-resource languages  as well. The approach demonstrates how freely available web  pages can be used to construct comprehensive text corpora,  which are of fundamental importance for natural language  processing. In an experimental evaluation, we show that  using the new corpus leads to significant improvements for  the task of language modeling. To capture new content, our  approach will run continuously to keep increasing the  corpus over time.},
