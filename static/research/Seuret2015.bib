 abstract = {The term "historical documents" encompasses an enormous  variety of document types considering different scripts,  languages, writing supports, and degradation degrees. For  automatic processing with machine learning and pattern  recognition methods, it would be ideal to share labeled  learning samples and trained statistical models across  similar documents, avoiding a retraining from scratch for  every historical document anew. In this paper, we propose  using the reconstruction error of autoencoders to compare  historical manuscripts with the goal of clustering them  according to their visual appearance. A low reconstruction  error suggests visual similarity between a new manuscript  and a known manuscript, for which the autoencoder was  trained in an unsupervised fashion. Preliminary experiments  conducted on 10 different manuscripts written with ink on  parchment demonstrate the ability of the reconstruction  error to group similar writing styles. For discriminating  between Carolingian and cursive script, in particular,  near-perfect results are reported.},
