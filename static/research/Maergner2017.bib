 abstract = {Graphs provide a powerful representation formalism for  handwritten signatures, capturing local properties as well  as their relations. Yet, although introduced early for  signature verification, only a few current systems rely on  graph-based representations. A possible reason is the high  computational complexity involved for matching two general  graphs. In this paper, we introduce a novel structural  approach to offline signature verification using an  efficient cubic-time approximation of graph edit distance.  We put forward several ways of creating, normalizing, and  comparing signature graphs built from keypoints and  investigate their performance on three benchmark datasets.  The experiments demonstrate a promising performance of the  proposed structural approach when compared with the state  of the art.},
