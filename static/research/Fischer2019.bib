 abstract = {The Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements analytically  describes pen tip movements as a sequence of elementary  strokes with lognormal speed. The theory has been confirmed  in a large number of experimental evaluations, achieving a  high reconstruction quality when compared with observed  trajectories and providing pertinent features for  biomedical applications as well as biometric  identification. So far, the Kinematic Theory has focused on  one-dimensional movements with the Delta-Lognormal model  and on two-dimensional movements with the Sigma-Lognormal  model. In this chapter, we present a model for movements in  three dimensions, which naturally extends the  Sigma-Lognormal approach. We evaluate our method on two  action recognition datasets and an air-writing dataset,  demonstrating a high reconstruction quality for modelling  rapid 3D movements in all cases.},
