 abstract = {Graph representations have been widely used in pattern  recognition thanks to their powerful representation  formalism and rich theoretical background. A number of  errortolerant graph matching algorithms such as graph edit  distance have been proposed for computing a distance  between two labelled graphs. However, they typically suffer  from a high computational complexity, which makes it  difficult to apply these matching algorithms in a real  scenario. In this paper, we propose an efficient graph  distance based on the emerging field of geometric deep  learning. Our method employs a message passing neural  network to capture the graph structure and learns a metric  with a siamese network approach. The performance of the  proposed graph distance is validated in two application  cases, graph classification and graph retrieval of  handwritten words, and shows a promising performance when  compared with (approximate) graph edit distance  benchmarks.},
