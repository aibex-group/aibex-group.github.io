 abstract = {In histopathology, histologic elements are not randomly  located across an image but organize into structured  patterns. In this regard, classification tasks or feature  extraction from histology images may require context  information to increase performance. In this work, we  explore the importance of keeping context information for a  cell classification task on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E)  scanned whole slide images (WSI) in colorectal cancer. We  show that to differentiate normal from malignant epithelial  cells, the environment around the cell plays a critical  role. We propose here an image augmentation based on gamma  variations to guide deep learning models to focus on the  object of interest while keeping context information. This  augmentation method yielded more specific models and helped  to increase the model performance (weighted F1 score  with/without gamma augmentation respectively, PanNuke:  99.49 vs 99.37 and TCGA: 91.38 vs. 89.12, p &lt; 0.05).},
