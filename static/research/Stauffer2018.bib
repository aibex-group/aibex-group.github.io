 abstract = {The accessibility to handwritten historical documents is  often constrained by the limited feasibility of automatic  full transcriptions. Keyword Spotting (KWS), that allows to  retrieve arbitrary query words from documents, has been  proposed as alternative. In the present paper, we make use  of graphs for representing word images. The actual keyword  spotting is thus based on matching a query graph with all  documents graphs. However, even with relative fast  approximation algorithms the shear amount of matchings  might limit the practical application of this approach. For  this reason we present two novel filters with linear time  complexity that allow to substantially reduce the number of  graph matchings actually required. In particular, these  filters estimate a graph dissimilarity between a query  graph and all document graphs based on their node and edge  distribution in a polar coordinate system. Eventually, all  graphs from the document with distributions that differ to  heavily from the queryâ€™s node/edge distribution are  eliminated. In an experimental evaluation on four different  historical documents, we show that about 90% of the  matchings can be omitted, while the KWS accuracy is not  negatively affected.},
