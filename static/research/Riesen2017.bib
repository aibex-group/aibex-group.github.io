 abstract = {The present paper is concerned with graph edit distance,  which is widely accepted as one of the most flexible graph  dissimilarity measures available. A recent algorithmic  framework for approximating the graph edit distance  overcomes the major drawback of this distance model, viz.  its exponential time complexity. Yet, this particular  approximation suffers from an overestimation of the true  edit distance in general. Overall aim of the present paper  is to improve the distance quality of this approximation by  means of a post-processing search procedure. The employed  search procedure is based on the idea of simulated  annealing, which turns out to be particularly suitable for  complex optimization problems. In an experimental  evaluation on several graph data sets the benefit of this  extension is empirically confirmed.},
