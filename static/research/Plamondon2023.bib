 abstract = {This invited special session of IGS 2023 presents the  works carried out at Laboratoire Scribens and some of its  collaborating laboratories. It summarises the 17 talks  presented in the colloquium #611 entitled « La  lognormalité: une fenêtre ouverte sur le contrôle  neuromoteur» (Lognormality: a window opened on neuromotor  control), at the 2023 conference of the Association  Francophone pour le Savoir (ACFAS) on May 10, 2023. These  talks covered a wide range of subjects related to the  Kinematic Theory, including key elements of the theory,  some gesture analysis algorithms that have emerged from it,  and its application to various fields, particularly in  biomedical engineering and human-machine interaction.},
