 abstract = {Ground truth is both â€“ indispensable for training and  evaluating document analysis methods, and yet very tedious  to create manually. This especially holds true for complex  historical manuscripts that exhibit challenging layouts  with interfering and overlapping handwriting. In this  paper, we propose a novel semi-automatic system to support  layout annotations in such a scenario based on document  graphs and a pen-based scribbling interaction. On the one  hand, document graphs provide a sparse page representation  that is already close to the desired ground truth and on  the other hand, scribbling facilitates an efficient and  convenient pen-based interaction with the graph. The  performance of the system is demonstrated in the context of  a newly introduced database of historical manuscripts with  complex layouts.},
