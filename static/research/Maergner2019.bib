 abstract = {Offline signature verification is a challenging pattern  recognition task where a writer model is inferred using  only a small number of genuine signatures. A combination of  complementary writer models can make it more difficult for  an attacker to deceive the verification system. In this  work, we propose to combine a recent structural approach  based on graph edit distance with a statistical approach  based on deep triplet networks. The combination of the  structural and statistical models achieve significant  improvements in performance on four publicly available  benchmark datasets, highlighting their complementary  perspectives.},
