 abstract = {Graph edit distance is one of the most popular graph  matching paradigms available. By means of a reformulation  of graph edit distance to an instance of a linear sum  assignment problem, the major drawback of this  dissimilarity model, viz. the exponential time complexity,  has been invalidated recently. Yet, the substantial  decrease of the computation time is at the expense of an  approximation error. The present paper introduces a novel  transformation that processes the underlying cost model  into a utility model. The benefit of this transformation is  that it enables the integration of additional information  in the assignment process. We empirically confirm the  positive effects of this transformation on three standard  graph data sets. That is, we show that the accuracy of a  distance based classifier can be improved with the proposed  transformation while the run time remains nearly  unaffected.},
