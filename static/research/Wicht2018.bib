 abstract = {Deep Learning Library (DLL) is a library for machine  learning with deep neural networks that focuses on speed.  It supports feedforward neural networks such as  fully-connected Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our main motivation  for this work was to propose and evaluate novel software  engineering strategies with potential to accelerate runtime  for training and inference. Such strategies are mostly  independent of the underlying deep learning algorithms. On  three different datasets and for four different neural  network models, we compared DLL to five popular deep  learning libraries. Experimentally, it is shown that the  proposed library is systematically and significantly faster  on CPU and GPU. In terms of classification performance,  similar accuracies as the other libraries are reported.},
