 abstract = {The universality check of Büchi automata is a foundational  problem in automata-based formal verification, closely  related to the complementation problem, and is known to be  PSPACE-complete. This article introduces a novel approach  for creating labelled datasets of Büchi automata concerning  their universality. We start with small automata, where the  universality check can still be algorithmically performed  within a reasonable timeframe, and then apply  transformations that provably preserve (non-)universality  while increasing their size. This approach enables the  generation of large datasets of labelled Büchi automata  without the need for an explicit and computationally  intensive universality check. We subsequently employ these  generated datasets to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)  for the purpose of classifying automata with respect to  their (non-)universality. The classification results  indicate that such a network can learn patterns related to  the behaviour of Büchi automata that facilitate the  recognition of universality. Additionally, our results on  randomly generated automata, which were not constructed  using the transformation techniques, demonstrate the  network’s potential in classifying Büchi automata with  respect to universality, extending its applicability beyond  cases generated using a specific technique.},
