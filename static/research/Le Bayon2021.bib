 abstract = {The importance of engineers is increasingly recognized in  soil science because of their implication in most important  pedological processes. Furthermore, they contribute to  ecological functions provided by soils in both natural and  human-modified environments. In this review, we focus on  the role of two ecosystem engineers: (1) plants, their root  system, and associated microorganisms and (2) earthworms.  First, we explain why they are considered as major soil  engineers, and which variables (texture, porosity,  nutrient, and moisture dynamics) control their activities  in space and time (hotspots and hot moments). Then, their  roles in three processes of soil formation are reviewed,  namely, rock and mineral weathering, soil structure  (formation, stabilization, and disintegration), and  bioturbation. For each of them, the involved mechanisms  that occur at different spatial scales (from local to  landscape) are presented. On one hand, tree uprooting plays  a key role in rock weathering and soil profile  bioturbation. In addition, living and dead roots also  contribute to rock alteration and aggregation. On the other  hand, earthworms are mainly involved in the formation of  aggregates and burrows through their bioturbation  activities and to a less extent in weathering processes.  The long-term effects of such mechanisms on soil  heterogeneity, soil development, and pathways of  pedogenesis are discussed. Finally, we show how these two  main ecosystem engineers contribute to provisioning and  regulating services. Through their physical activities of  burrowing and soil aggregation, earthworms and plants  increase plant productivity, water infiltration, and  climate warming mitigation. They act as catalysts and  provide, transform, and translocate organic matter and  nutrients throughout the soil profile. Finally, due to  inter- and intraspecific interactions and/or symbiosis with  microorganisms (arbuscular fungi, bacteria), they enhance  soil fertility, decrease parasitic action, and bioremediate  some pollutants. Future research is, however, still needed  for a better understanding of the relationships between  adequate soil management, agricultural practices, and soil  biota in a perspective of relevant maintenance and  durability of ecological services.},
