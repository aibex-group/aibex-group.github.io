 abstract = {Keyword Spotting (KWS) offers a convenient way to improve  the accessibility to historical handwritten documents by  retrieving search terms in scanned document images. The  approach for KWS proposed in the present paper is based on  segmented word images that are represented by means of  different types of graphs. The actual keyword spotting is  based on matching a query graph with a set of document  graphs using the concept of graph edit distance. In  particular, we propose to employ ensemble methods for KWS  with graphs. That is, a query graph is not matched against  one but several different graphs representing the same  document word. Eventually, we use different strategies to  combine these individual graph dissimilarities. In an  experimental evaluation on two benchmark datasets, the  proposed ensemble methods outperform the individual  ensemble members as well as four state-of-the-art reference  systems based on dynamic time warping.},
