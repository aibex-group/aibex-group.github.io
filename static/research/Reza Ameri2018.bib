 abstract = {Keyword spotting enables content-based retrieval of  scanned historical manuscripts using search terms, which,  in turn, facilitates the indexation in digital libraries.  Recent approaches include graph-based representations that  capture the complex structure of handwriting. However, the  high representational power of graphs comes at the cost of  high computational complexity for graph matching. In this  article, we investigate the potential of Hausdorff edit  distance (HED) for keyword spotting. It is an efficient  quadratictime approximation of the graph edit distance. In  a comprehensive experimental evaluation with four types of  handwriting graphs and four benchmark datasets (George  Washington, Parzival, Botany, and Alvermann  Konzilsprotokolle), we demonstrate a strong performance of  the proposed HED-based method when compared with the state  of the art, both, in terms of precision and speed.},
