 abstract = {With the rise of graph neural networks, sometimes also  referred to as geometric deep learning, a range of new  types of network layers have been introduced. Since this is  a very recent development, the design of new architectures  relies a lot on intuition and trial-and-error. In this  paper, we evaluate the effect of adding graph pooling  layers to a network, which down-sample graphs, and evaluate  the performance on three different datasets. We find that  especially for smaller graphs, adding pooling layers should  be done with caution, as they can have a negative effect on  the overall performance.},
