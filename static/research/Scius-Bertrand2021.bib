 abstract = {Images of Historical Vietnamese stone engravings provide  historians with a unique opportunity to study the past of  the country. However, due to the large heterogeneity of  thousands of images regarding both the text foreground and  the stone background, it is difficult to use automatic  document analysis methods for supporting manual  examination, especially with a view to the labeling effort  needed for training machine learning systems. In this  paper, we present a method for finding the location of Chu  Nom characters in the main text of the steles without the  need of any human annotation. Using self-calibration, fully  convolutional object detection methods trained on printed  characters are successfully adapted to the handwritten  image collection. The achieved detection results are  promising for subsequent document analysis tasks, such as  keyword spotting or transcription.},
