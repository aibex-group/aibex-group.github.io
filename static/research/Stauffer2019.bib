 abstract = {In contrast to statistical representations, graphs offer  some inherent advantages when it comes to handwriting  representation. That is, graphs are able to adapt their  size and structure to the individual handwriting and  represent binary relationships that might exist within the  handwriting. We observe an increasing number of graph-based  keyword spotting frameworks in the last years. In general,  keyword spotting allows to retrieve instances of an  arbitrary query in documents. It is common practice to  optimise keyword spotting frameworks for each document  individually, and thus, the overall generalisability  remains somehow questionable. In this paper, we focus on  this question by conducting a cross-evaluation experiment  on four handwritten historical documents. We observe a  direct relationship between parameter settings and the  actual handwriting. We also propose different ensemble  strategies that allow to keep up with individually  optimised systems without a priori knowledge of a certain  manuscript. Such a system can potentially be applied to new  documents without prior optimisation.},
