 abstract = {One of the main challenges of automatically transcribing  large collections of handwritten letters is to cope with  the high variability of writing styles present in the  collection. In particular, the writing styles of  non-frequent writers, who have contributed only few  letters, are often missing in the annotated learning  samples used for training handwriting recognition systems.  In this paper, we introduce the Bullinger dataset for  writer adaptation, which is based on the Heinrich Bullinger  letter collection from the 16th century, using a subset of  3,622 annotated letters (about 1.2 million words) from 306  writers. We provide baseline results for handwriting  recognition with modern recognizers, before and after the  application of standard techniques for supervised  adaptation of frequent writers and self-supervised  adaptation of non-frequent writers.},
