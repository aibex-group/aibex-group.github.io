 abstract = {Real-time interaction with augmented reality is a novel  material for dancers and choreographers to work with on  stage. Rather than focusing on a perfect synchronization  between dance and music, it allows the dancers to affect  their audiovisual environment and react to the change. In  this paper, we report the process and outcome of a  col-laborative effort between art and technology that has  explored this new material and resulted in the dance  performance Nautilus. We suggest an interaction method  based on a depth sensor and pixel-cloud avatars that allows  the dancers to interact reliably with an augmented reality  while moving freely on stage.},
