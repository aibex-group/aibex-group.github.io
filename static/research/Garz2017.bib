 abstract = {In historical manuscripts, humans can detect handwritten  words, lines, and decorations with lightness even if they  do not know the language or the script. Yet for automatic  processing this task has proven elusive, especially in the  case of handwritten documents with complex layouts, which  is why semiautomatic methods that integrate the human user  into the process are needed. In this paper, we introduce a  user-centered segmentation method based on document graphs  and scribbling interaction. The graphs capture a sparse  representation of the document's structure that can then be  edited by the user with a stylus on a touch-sensitive  screen. We evaluate the proposed method on a newly  introduced database of historical manuscripts with complex  layout and demonstrate, first, that the document graphs are  already close to the desired segmentation and, second, that  scribbling allows a natural and efficient interaction.},
