 abstract = {Supervised learning is constrained by the availability of  labeled data, which are especially expensive to acquire in  the field of digital pathology. Making use of open-source  data for pre-training or using domain adaptation can be a  way to overcome this issue. However, pre-trained networks  often fail to generalize to new test domains that are not  distributed identically due to tissue stainings, types, and  textures variations. Additionally, current domain  adaptation methods mainly rely on fully-labeled source  datasets. In this work, we propose Self-Rule to Multi-Adapt  (SRMA), which takes advantage of self-supervised learning  to perform domain adaptation, and removes the necessity of  fully-labeled source datasets. SRMA can effectively  transfer the discriminative knowledge obtained from a few  labeled source domain’s data to a new target domain without  requiring additional tissue annotations. Our method  harnesses both domains’ structures by capturing visual  similarity with intra-domain and cross-domain  self-supervision. Moreover, we present a generalized  formulation of our approach that allows the framework to  learn from multiple source domains. We show that our  proposed method outperforms baselines for domain adaptation  of colorectal tissue type classification in single and  multi-source settings, and further validate our approach on  an in-house clinical cohort. The code and trained models  are available open-source:  https://github.com/christianabbet/SRA.},
