 abstract = {Handwriting recognition enables the automatic  transcription of large volumes of digitized collections,  providing access to the content. However, regardless of the  system used, some recognition errors still oc-cur. With the  advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the ques-tion  arises whether these models can improve handwriting  recognition as a post-processing step. We have developed a  method for LLM-based post-correction and evaluated it on  three benchmark datasets, namely Washington, Bentham, and  IAM. We consistently achieved a character error rate  reduction of up to 30%, though we observed significant  vari-ability depending on the prompt and the LLM used.},
