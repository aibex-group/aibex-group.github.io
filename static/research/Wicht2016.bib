 abstract = {Deep learning had a significant impact on diverse pattern  recognition tasks in the recent past. In this paper, we  investigate its potential for keyword spotting in  handwritten documents by designing a novel feature  extraction system based on Convolutional Deep Belief  Networks. Sliding window features are learned from word  images in an unsupervised manner. The proposed features are  evaluated both for template-based word spotting with  Dynamic Time Warping and for learning-based word spotting  with Hidden Markov Models. In an experimental evaluation on  three benchmark data sets with historical and modern  handwriting, it is shown that the proposed learned features  outperform three standard sets of handcrafted features.},
