 abstract = {Handwriting recognition is a key technology for accessing  the content of old manuscripts, helping to preserve  cultural heritage. Deep learning shows an impressive  performance in solving this task. However, to achieve its  full potential, it requires a large amount of labeled data,  which is difficult to obtain for ancient languages and  scripts. Often, a trade-off has to be made between ground  truth quantity and quality, as is the case for the recently  introduced Bullinger database. It contains an impressive  amount of over a hundred thousand labeled text line images  of mostly premodern German and Latin texts that were  obtained by automatically aligning existing page-level  transcriptions with text line images. However, the  alignment process introduces systematic errors, such as  wrongly hyphenated words. In this paper, we investigate the  impact of such errors on training and evaluation and  suggest means to detect and correct typical alignment  errors.},
