 abstract = {Stone engravings on Vietnamese steles are an invaluable  resource for historians to study the life of the villagers  in the past. Thanks to pictures taken of stampings of the  steles, they can be investigated today in the form of  digital images. Automatic keyword spotting is a promising  means to access the textual content of the images, allowing  to retrieve steles that contain a certain query term. In  this paper, we present a complete pipeline for retrieving  Chu Nom characters in Vietnamese steles that operates fully  automatically on the original images, without the need for  preprocessing, segmentation, or human annotation. It  combines a self-calibration approach to character detection  using deep convolutional neural networks with a graph-based  approach to keyword spotting that compares templates of the  search term with detected characters based on structural  properties.},
