 abstract = {The dynamic signature is a biometric trait widely used and  accepted for verifying a person's identity. Current  automatic signature-based biometric systems typically  require five, ten, or even more specimens of a person's  signature to learn intrapersonal variability sufficient to  provide an accurate verification of the individual's  identity. To mitigate this drawback, this paper proposes a  procedure for training with only a single reference  signature. Our strategy consists of duplicating the given  signature a number of times and training an automatic  signature verifier with each of the resulting signatures.  The duplication scheme is based on a sigma lognormal  decomposition of the reference signature. Two methods are  presented to create human-like duplicated signatures: the  first varies the strokes' lognormal parameters  (stroke-wise) whereas the second modifies their virtual  target points (target-wise). A challenging benchmark,  assessed with multiple state-of-the-art automatic signature  verifiers and multiple databases, proves the robustness of  the system. Experimental results suggest that our system,  with a single reference signature, is capable of achieving  a similar performance to standard verifiers trained with up  to five signature specimens.},
