 abstract = {Automatic handwriting recognition for historical documents  is a key element for making our cultural heritage available  to researchers and the general public. However, current  approaches based on machine learning require a considerable  amount of annotated learning samples to read ancient  scripts and languages. Producing such ground truth is a  laborious and time-consuming task that often requires human  experts. In this paper, to cope with a limited amount of  learning samples, we explore the impact of using synthetic  text line images to support the training of handwriting  recognition systems. For generating text lines, we consider  lineGen, a recent GAN-based approach, and for handwriting  recognition, we consider HTR-Flor, a state-of-the-art  recognition system. Different meta-learning strategies are  explored that schedule the addition of synthetic text line  images to the existing real samples. In an experimental  evaluation on the well-known Bentham dataset as well as the  newly introduced Bullinger dataset, we demonstrate a  significant improvement of the recognition performance when  combining real and synthetic samples.},
