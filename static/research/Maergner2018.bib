 abstract = {Biometric authentication by means of handwritten  signatures is a challenging pattern recognition task, which  aims to infer a writer model from only a handful of genuine  signatures. In order to make it more difficult for a forger  to attack the verification system, a promising strategy is  to combine different writer models. In this work, we  propose to complement a recent structural approach to  offline signature verification based on graph edit distance  with a statistical approach based on metric learning with  deep neural networks. On the MCYT and GPDS benchmark  datasets, we demonstrate that combining the structural and  statistical models leads to significant improvements in  performance, profiting from their complementary  properties.},
