 abstract = {This project explores the feasibility of remote patient  monitoring based on the analysis of 3D  movements captured  with smartwatches. We base our analysis on the Kinematic  Theory of Rapid Human Movement. We have validated our  research in a real case scenario for stroke rehabilitation  at the Guttmann Institute5 (neurorehabilitation hospital),  showing promising results. Our work could have a great  impact in remote healthcare applications, improving the  medical efficiency and reducing the healthcare costs.  Future steps include more clinical validation, developing  multi-modal analysis architectures (analysing data from  sensors, images, audio, etc.), and exploring the  application of our technology to monitor other  neurodegenerative diseases.},
