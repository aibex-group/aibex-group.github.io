 abstract = {For several decades graphs act as a powerful and flexible  representation formalism in pattern recognition and related  fields. For instance, graphs have been employed for  specific tasks in image and video analysis, bioinformatics,  or network analysis. Yet, graphs are only rarely used when  it comes to handwriting recognition. One possible reason  for this observation might be the increased complexity of  many algorithmic procedures that take graphs, rather than  feature vectors, as their input. However, with the rise of  efficient graph kernels and fast approximative graph  matching algorithms, graph-based handwriting representation  could become a versatile alternative to traditional  methods. This paper aims at making a seminal step towards  promoting graphs in the field of handwriting recognition.  In particular, we introduce a set of six different graph  formalisms that can be employed to represent handwritten  word images. The different graph representations for words,  are analysed in a classification experiment (using a  distance based classifier). The results of this word  classifier provide a benchmark for further investigations.},
