# Semantic Writer Identification for Historical Documents of Swiss Foreign Politics

**Contact:** <a href="mailto:marco.peer@unifr.ch">Marco Peer</a>

## Overview
This thesis aims to explore **semantic writer identification** for the historical documents available at DODIS. The corpus consists of approximately **50,000 documents** related to Swiss foreign policy. A key research question is if there is sufficient semantic variety in the documents to reliably capture individual writing styles.

Existing datasets in related work present limitations: some are **small** (e.g., IMDB62), while others are **topically diverse** (e.g., social media posts), making it difficult to isolate semantic features that characterize individual writers. In contrast, our dataset offers approximately **25,000 documents with known authors** (**8000 writers** with three or more documents). The documents are narrowly focused on topics in the domain of **Swiss foreign policy**.


## Objectives
- Review state-of-the-art methods for writer identification and style extraction  
- Select an appropriate baseline method from related work (e.g., transformer-based architectures, LLMs)  
- Implement and evaluate semantic writer identification techniques on the DODIS corpus  

## Methodology
1. **Literature Review** – Examine current approaches in writer identification, style extraction, and semantic feature modeling  
2. **Implementation** – Implementation of semantic analysis/writing style extraction for writer identification  
3. **Evaluation** – Benchmark the pipeline on the DODIS dataset, with optional comparison to other datasets in related work
4. **Reporting** – Produce the final thesis, presentation, and optional publication  

## Skills Required
- Proficiency in Python programming  
- Experience with deep learning frameworks (preferably PyTorch)  
- Interest in historical document analysis and natural language processing
