 abstract = {Approximation of graph edit distance in polynomial time  enables us to compare large, arbitrarily labeled graphs for  structural pattern recognition. In a recent approximation  framework, bipartite graph matching (BP) has been proposed  to reduce the problem of edit distance to a cubic-time  linear sum assignment problem (LSAP) between local  substructures. Following the same line of research, first  attempts towards quadratic-time approximation have been  made recently, including a lower bound based on Hausdorff  matching (Hausdorff Edit Distance) and an upper bound based  on greedy assignment (Greedy Edit Distance). In this paper,  we compare the two approaches and derive a novel upper  bound (BP2) which combines advantages of both. In an  experimental evaluation on the IAM graph database  repository, we demonstrate that the proposed quadratic-time  methods perform equally well or, quite surprisingly, in  some cases even better than the cubic-time method.},
