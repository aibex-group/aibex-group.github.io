 abstract = {Automatic layout analysis of historical documents has to  cope with a large number of different scripts, writing  supports, and digitalization qualities. Under these  conditions, the design of robust features for machine  learning is a highly challenging task. We use convolutional  autoencoders to learn features from the images. In order to  increase the classification accuracy and to reduce the  feature dimension, in this paper we propose a novel feature  selection method. The method cascades adapted versions of  two conventional methods. Compared to three conventional  methods and our previous work, the proposed method achieves  a higher classification accuracy in most cases, while  maintaining low feature dimension. In addition, we find  that a significant number of autoencoder features are  redundant or irrelevant for the classification, and we give  our explanations. To the best of our knowledge, this paper  is one of the first investigations in the field of image  processing on the detection of redundancy and irrelevance  of autoencoder features using feature selection.},
